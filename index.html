            <p>
                It all started with a simple question: <em>How do the markets actually work?</em> Like many, I was 
                initially overwhelmed by the jargon and technicality of the financial world. Instead of turning 
                away, I decided to dive deep into the humanities of finance—understanding the psychology, 
                the history, and the discipline required to trade effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2026, I committed to a path of radical transparency in my learning. I realized that 
                true mastery doesn't come from mindless drills, but from acquiring the indispensable skill 
                of critical thinking within the markets.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, my mission is to share this roadmap with you. I distil complex trading practices into 
                actionable insights, helping you navigate your own financial education without the noise.
